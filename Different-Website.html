    	<td>Aling Rosa Got sick and so Pinang had to do the housework. One day, she couldn't find the ladle. This made Aling Rosa so mad that she yelled at her "Naku! Pinang, sana'y magkaroon ka ng maraming mata upang makakita mo and lahat ng bagay at hindi ka na tanong nang tanong sa akin."</th>
        <td>Pinang left to go look for the ladle but didn't come back home. Aling Rosa went looking for her and asked the neighbors where she went but no one saw her. One day, an unexpected flower suddenly showed up at her house and she took care of it. It grew head-shaped with many eyes, she remembered what she said to her daughter and named it Pinang and altered it to Pinya.</td>
